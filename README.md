P11.c -> Counts the maximum number Intervals that have a common point using the Brute force approach. The program
prompts user to enter a file name to read the input. Once the number of Intervals are computed, the results are 
printed to the screen with the time taken. It is observed that it taken around 11800 ms to compute the maximum 
number of intervals when used on a file with 30,000 intervals points. 

P12.c -> Counts the maximum number Intervals that have a common point using the pre-sorting approach. The program
prompts user to enter a file name to read the input. Once the number of Intervals are computed, the results are 
printed to the screen with the time taken. It is observed that it taken around 40ms to compute the maximum 
number of intervals when used on a file with 30,000 intervals points.
